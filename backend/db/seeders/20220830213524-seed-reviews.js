    review: 'My boyfriend and I stayed at the Milky Way Run and had such a wonderful time! Amy made everything super easy, and were incredibly happy with our accommodations! We felt incredibly safe and relaxed during our stay. The stars were stunning and the drive to Big Bend was not too long and was truly stunning! We would definitely stay here again and recommend to others.',

    review: "If you want to getaway, this cute little home makes a great stay. It was a bit smaller than I expected but that had no affect on how I felt about this place. Washing dishes, showering and even using the restrooms was cool experience. At night, you're able to catch a beautiful view of the stars.",

    review: 'This campsite was a little further from The Big Bend than I had expected, and it took travel time to get to any attraction close by. It is a great location for star gazing and to just get away, but expect a bit more traveling if your main goal is to see the National Park.',
